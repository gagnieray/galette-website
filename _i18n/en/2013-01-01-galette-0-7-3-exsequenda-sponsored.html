<p>First of all, a very good 2013 year to all :-) Epiphany will be a bit early this year ;-)</p>


<p>Exsequenda company (which contact me for one of their clients) and myself are proud to present you this new Galette release. It is the second sponsored release :-)</p>


<p>As a reminder, a "Sponsored release" means that some develpments have been paid via my self-employment activity and reversed to the community.</p>


<p>Here are new features that has been implemented for that sponsoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>fields visibility configuration (visibles, not visibles or visibles for administrators only),</li>
<li>advanced search in all members fields (including dynamic fields),</li>
<li>login and password may now be not required (default random values will be generated),</li>
<li>improve and fix dynamic fields labels translations,</li>
<li>help window editing mails texts,</li>
<li>public members list pagination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fields visibility configuration and advanced search has both been requested for a while, it has finally been achieved! A big thanks to Matthieu who make possible to implement those new features into Galette :-)</p>
