<p><a href="https://vote.galette.eu/posts/7/import-des-champs-dynamiques">Dynamic fields import from a CSV file</a> is a common asked feature. It is the <a href="https://vote.galette.eu/?view=most-wanted">demand number one </a> on voting system ;)</p>


<p>This feature has been recently integrated into Galette development branch! For the occasion, nightly Galette version has been updated, for whose who want to install and test it can do rigth now. See also <a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/versions/66">Galette 0.9.4 modifications list</a> (which may still evolve).</p>


<p>But I've also been thinking about others, and I've decided to put online a <a href="https://demo.galette.eu">Galette demonstration version</a>; which currently points on development branch. Ir's entirely resetted each night.</p>
