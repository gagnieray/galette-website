<p>A new Galette version, 0.7.8, has been release, it is sponsorised by Roland; as well as Maps and Paypal plugins :-)</p>


<p>The main change is about plugins that can now have public pages. The Paypal plugin uses that new feature, as does Maps.</p>


<p>Maps plugin also get some new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>administrators and staff members can now manage members coordinates,</li>
<li>member (up to date or not) can see themselves on the map if they're logged in,</li>
<li>administrators and staff members can see all geolocalized members, exept inactive accounts,</li>
<li>a full screen button has been added for more comfort.</li>
</ul>

<p>On an additional note; it is the latest release of this year; but also tha last 0.7 Galette serie. Next year will see Galette 0.8, with some important changes, and the end of PHP 5.3 support.</p>


<p>Big thanks to Roland for his sponsorship, season's greetings to you all.</p>
