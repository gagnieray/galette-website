<p>Galette's development has not been frozen after 0.7.2 AFUL sponsored version; 7 corrective releases has been released since.</p>


<p>And here is the eighth one, that fixes a performance issue on members lists. As an illustration , below a <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/xhprof" hreflang="en">XHProf</a> (a hierarchical profiler tool) resume comparison; so it seems figures say more than words :p</p>

<p>Those performances issues were impacting:</p>
<ul>
<li>members management page,</li>
<li>public members list,</li>
<li>contributions creation and edition,</li>
<li>transactions creation and edition,</li>
<li>groups management.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Anatole from <a href="http://leclub404.com/" hreflang="fr">club 404</a> to report the issue, and to provide me all needed elements to have it fixed :-)</p>
