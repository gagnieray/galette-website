<h3>This was of course an april fool :-)</h3>

<p>For a quite long time, I'm wondering if I must keep SQLite support into Galette. It takes very much time, and it is very complex; and for many reasons, I do not have much free time actually, and I have to find a solution.</p>


<p>All things considered; it appears that the worst database engine support is not SQLite, but MySQL.<br />
I've so decided to stop MySQL support in Galette.</p>


<p>In concrete terms, that means all new Galette releases will no longer have MySQL support, but also all bugs and questions related to MySQL will no be processed. Users who use this engine should consider to migrate as soon as possible.</p>
