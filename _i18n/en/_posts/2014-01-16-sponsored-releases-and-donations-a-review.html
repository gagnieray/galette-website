<p>About one year and a half ago, I began a self-employee activity, and almost at the same time, I've added a "donate" button on the website. I communicate on both points several time, time to review has come :-)</p>


<p>Le'ts start with my self-employment activity. Initial goal was to boost the Galette project, with defined requests (and not quick phrases on mailing list). I have to admit: This is a success; and I hope that will continue!</p>


<p>Seven sponsored releases were born :-)<br />
Every release includes ordered features, as well as some others I've take in charge to integrate myself (as in regular releases).</p>


<p>Here a resume of various enhancements ordered, and developped as of today:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve dynamic fields interface,</li>
<li>hyperlinks management in dynamic fields,</li>
<li>credentials length changes,</li>
<li>login and password may now be not required,</li>
<li>fields visibility configuration,</li>
<li>advanced search,</li>
<li>titles management,</li>
<li>members search via their contributions,</li>
<li>export as CSV filtered members list,</li>
<li>contributions reminders, automated via cron,</li>
<li>parameted invoices and receipt print in PDF (that would be reused for all other Galette PDF),</li>
<li>external script call after a new contribution (for accountancy export, for example),</li>
<li>members imports from CSV files,</li>
<li>add attachments to mailings,</li>
<li>plugins public pages reworking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Auto and Maps plugins also get sponsored enhancements.</p>


<p>It is useless to say that those enhancements are directly benefic for the community. I'd like to thanks once again <a href="http://aful.org/" hreflang="fr">AFUL non profit organization</a>, <a href="https://france.debian.net/" hreflang="fr">Debian France non profit organization</a>, the Exsequenda company, and <a href="http://www.leclub404.com/" hreflang="fr">Club 404 non profit organization</a> which has sponsored those releases. Loïs and Roland also sponsored developments, as individuals, thanks to them.</p>


<p>Let's talk about donations. There were no specific target here, just another way for those who did not want to contribute or order new features (thoses orders have a cost, would you believe?) to contribute (trying to motivate me :p).</p>


<p>Well... On that part... It's quite a bum note. According to donate promises (see mailing list archives), it is not, but in facts, only four donations has been made (thank to generous sponsors, they'll recognize themselves); and moreover from people who already are active contributors!</p>


<p>Finally a big part of the community does not contribute in code, support, documentation or financing,.. Evolutions requests are numerous, but with a minimum of involvment from users, they'll be devoted to stay simple requests.</p>


<p>It must be noted that it does concerns - and that's great! - the entire comminuty, and that some people do contribute developping some features, testing, or answering tracker requests (those ones are sometimes scatterbrain or imprecise). A very Big Thank to them!</p>
