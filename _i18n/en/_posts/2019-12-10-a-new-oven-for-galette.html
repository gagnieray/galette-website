<p>For a good Galette we need a good oven...<br />
Mine has been built more than 9 years ago, a renew will be mandatory, it has been heavily used :)</p>


<p>So, I need a new computer with a sufficient configuration to work; and hardware is quite expensive...</p>


<p>I invite you to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8krlYNjX1j">donate to help me buy this computer</a> if you wish!</p>


<p>As a reminder, I'm the maintainer and developer of the project. With coding <strong>new features</strong> and <strong>technical evolutions</strong> (often complex); I'm also in charge of <strong>website</strong>, writting <strong>documentation</strong>, <strong>translations</strong>, <strong>user support</strong>, etc.<br />
And for all of that, I need a computer! :-)</p>


<p>I've created a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8krlYNjX1j">Paypal pool</a>, but you can still <a href="{% tl contact %}">contact me if you want to donate</a> another way ;)</p>


<p>Pool amount is top of the price bracket; but includes all required hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ventilated case</li>
<li>CPU Intel Core i7</li>
<li>Appropriate motherboard</li>
<li>32 Gio de RAM</li>
<li>Graphic card with dual screen support</li>
<li>2 screens</li>
<li>1Tio SSD (system) hard drive</li>
<li>2 x 4Tio hard drive (code, data, backups, ...)</li>
<li>Assembly</li>
<li>Keyboard and mouse</li>
</ul>


<p>Thank you in advance, remember it's almost X-Mas; and be sure I'll continue to add good butter to Galette :D</p>
