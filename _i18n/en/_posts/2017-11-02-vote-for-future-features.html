<p>This is something I have in mind for several years; but that has not been implemented yet...</p>


<p>The tracker where bugs and features are reported do its job; and it suits pretty well my needs (compared to others I can/have to test). But; if it is possible to report a bug or ask for a feature, nothing exists to know their popularity...</p>


<p>This is a feature request that exists for years on Redmine; but project's developer always refused to implement it. Several plugins were developed; but they seem to die quite soon after, unfortunately :/</p>


<p>I'd really want to avoid to duplicate information, but this is not possible. So, I propose you to <a href="https://galette.fider.io/">vote for future Galette features</a> using Fider :)</p>


<p>This voting system will not replace existing tracker; and popularity of any entry will not imply it will be implemented in the next release, but this will help me to know which feature <strong>you</strong> are waiting for!</p>
