<p><a href="https://forums.galette.eu">Galette discussion forums</a> are opening!</p>


<p>This is something that has been asked several times; but I never agree... Mainly beacause I was afraid of the time to spend on it. But I must admit some users are not comfortable with mailing lists; so I've decided to got for it :)</p>


<p>I hope that seems worthwhile; this has been a while this is planned ;-)</p>


<p>A very big thanks to Roland, who talked about that again, and has sponsorized theme creation and forums setup with a generous donation :)</p>


<p>Those forums are openend as an experiment for now. If they were spammed, attacked (hey Galette's demo...); or even if users would not respect rules (speak correctly, no insults, ...); they would be quickly closed.</p>


<p>Enjoy!</p>
