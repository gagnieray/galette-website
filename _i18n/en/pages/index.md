The name Galette is a French acronym for "Gestionnaire d'Adhérents en Ligne Extrêmement Tarabiscoté mais Tellement Efficace", freely translated to "Extremely Sophisticated but so Efficient On-Line Membership Manager". The french word "galette" also means (<em>popular</em>) "Money". Unfortunately, the translation removes all the fun!
